#So now We can use inputs more often
#Like this
legendName = input("Legend Name > ")
#Now an if statement
if legendName == "Flematrix":
  print("All enemies instantly die and you have found the GOD NAME CODE"
elif legendName == "Name"
  print("Haha real funny.")
else:
  print("Nice name")

#So now with this I'll explain it
#If checks for a certain condition
#elif is the inbetween of if and else
#else is basically the statement giving a diffrent outcome if the condition is not met
