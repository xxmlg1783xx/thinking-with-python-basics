print("Hello World!")
#Ah yes the most basic yet most iconic Python Line 
#It's even the first line of code you see when you create a python file
#But on to the lesson, the print command is used lots while programming with python. Its been used to print varibles and much more
#Heres an exampe
varExample = 2
print(varExample)
#Try running it and see what happens
#So after that you can do more with print, like this!
name = input("Name > ")
#Input is a command which allows you to set values after programming it if your using varibles
#But let's be honest that what most people use it for anyway
print(name)
#Okay with that out the way we can do more with python (In the next lesson)
#Open the next file to learn more
